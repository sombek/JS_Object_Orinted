# Welcome to Javascript Object-Oriented!

This repo includes Javascript Object-Oriented Example written in ECMA5. It helps to digest the OOP idea in Javascript

# Prototypes & Inheritance

Firstly, I'd recommend reading this article [Understanding Javascript Prototype Inheritance](https://hackernoon.com/understanding-javascript-prototype-and-inheritance-d55a9a23bde2)
Then watch this video [Javascript -- Prototypes, Prototypal Inheritance done right.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yvf_kUBZmXg&t=1791s) They are really great, and you can digest the Inheritance and prototypes well.

# The Example
The Example implements this UML diagram in JS OOP approach in ECMA5.
