# Welcome to Javascript Object-Orinted!

This repo includes Javascript Object-Orinted Example written in ECMA5. It helps to digest the OOP idea in Javascript

# Prototypes & Inheretance

Firstly, I'd recommend to read this article [Understanding Javascript Prototype Inheritance](https://hackernoon.com/understanding-javascript-prototype-and-inheritance-d55a9a23bde2)
Then watch this video [Javascript -- Prototypes, Prototypal Inheritance done right.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yvf_kUBZmXg&t=1791s) They are really great, and you can digest the Inheritance and prototypes well.

# The Example
